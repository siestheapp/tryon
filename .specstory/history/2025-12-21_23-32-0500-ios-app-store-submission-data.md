**Considering app store submission**

The user is asking about app store submission and whether to use fake user data. My concise answer is that while it's not required, a demo account is essential if login is involved. I should advise avoiding fake content in production and suggest using empty states or optional sample data. Including reviewer notes and test credentials is important, especially if the app requires an account. Also, data privacy is key—real personal data shouldn't be used. We could implement a demo mode with a minimal sample wardrobe for the app.</details></think>

No—**you don’t need to seed production with fake user data** to submit to the iOS App Store.

### What Apple actually cares about
- **App Review must be able to access core features.**
  - If your app **requires login**, you should either:
    - **Provide a review/demo account** (username/password) in **App Store Connect → App Review Notes**, or
    - Offer a **“Continue as guest / demo mode”** path that exposes enough functionality for review.
- **Don’t ship “fake people” data** that looks like real personal data.
  - Avoid seeded names/emails/addresses/measurements that could be interpreted as real users.
- **Good empty states are totally acceptable.**
  - It’s fine if a new account starts empty (no closet, no scans) as long as onboarding explains what to do next and nothing feels broken.

### When seeded/sample data *can* help (optional)
- If the app feels unusable without content, include **non-personal “sample items”** (e.g., “Sample Outfit”, “Example Fit”) that are clearly labeled, or a **demo dataset toggle**—but keep it **user-local** and easy to clear.

### Practical recommendation for your app
- If your flow is gated behind auth, provide **reviewer credentials** (or guest/demo).
- Prefer **empty states + a lightweight demo closet** over seeding “fake users” into a shared backend.

the use case of the app at this stage is for a user to log a piece of clothing he tries on. shouldnt we have some pieces logged forr the app store to see?

**Considering demo options**

I'm looking for some guidance here. Since I can't use any tools, I'm thinking of mentioning the reviewer account. It seems like a good idea to suggest a demo mode with prefilled items or perhaps local sample items for the first run. Adding an "Add sample item" button could also help! I can also provide some concise review notes to make everything clearer.</details></think>

Not necessarily—but **App Review does need to experience the core flow without it feeling broken**.

### What to do for your “log a piece of clothing I try on” MVP
- **If a brand‑new account can log an item in <1 minute**, you can ship with **zero pre-logged items** and rely on:
  - clear empty state copy (“No items yet — add the first thing you tried on”)
  - a prominent **“Log item”** CTA
- **If the experience feels empty/confusing until there’s data**, add **sample items** (recommended) rather than “fake users.”

### Best practice (App Review-friendly)
- **Provide a reviewer account** in App Review Notes, and on that account have **3–10 pre-logged clothing items** so they can instantly see the UI in a “filled” state.
  - This is normal and avoids seeding “fake user data” broadly—just a single demo account you control.

### Alternative (often even cleaner)
- Add an in-app option like **“Load sample closet”** / **“Try a demo item”** that creates **local sample entries** for that user (clearly labeled “Sample”), with a **“Clear sample data”** button.

### My recommendation for you right now
Use **one demo/review account with a few pre-logged items**, and still keep **good empty states** for real users. This gives review the “aha” immediately without you inventing a bunch of fake users.
