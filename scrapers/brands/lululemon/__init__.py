Lululemon brand module.

This subpackage exposes a stable API around the existing
`scripts/lululemon_full_ingest.py` implementation so that other code can
import Lululemon ingest helpers without depending on CLI script layout.

Over time, brand-specific orchestration (PDP/category entrypoints, Playwright
helpers, etc.) can move in here, while the legacy CLI scripts remain as thin
wrappers for backwards compatibility.
